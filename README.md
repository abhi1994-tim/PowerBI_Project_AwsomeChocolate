# PowerBI_Project_AwsomeChocolates

**Project Introduction:**

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive business analysis for a company named **Awesome Chocolates**. The primary goal of this analysis is to evaluate the company's performance across several key areas, including sales performance, customer behavior, and data-driven forecasting. 

To achieve this, I performed an in-depth examination of the company's sales data and customer metrics, which involved analyzing historical sales patterns, understanding customer purchasing behaviors, and projecting future trends. A significant part of this analysis included developing sales and customer forecasts for the upcoming three months, helping the company make informed decisions about inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

To ensure that the analysis aligned with Awesome Chocolates' business needs and objectives, I utilized a range of data processing techniques. These included data preprocessing to clean and structure the raw data, data transformation to ensure consistency and accuracy, and the use of DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for sophisticated data modeling and calculations. Each step was carefully executed to extract meaningful insights that could guide the companyâ€™s strategic planning and operational improvements.
